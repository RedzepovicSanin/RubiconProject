# Rubicon Project

This project was created as assignment for job application!

# Getting Project

Git clone https://github.com/RedzepovicSanin/RubiconProject to your folder and open it.

# Installing packages

Run `npm install` in your terminal. After all modules are installed, run dev server! (next step)

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Default browser will open with `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Build

If needed, run `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
This is only for production!

### IMPORTANT

While application looks just fine, and everything is functioning as it should, sometimes there are some console log errors that I couldn't fix, but they don't make any impact on application or project overall.
I hope in that somebody from Rubicon might explain those if I get a job. Thanks in advance!
